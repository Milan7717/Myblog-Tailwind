        web developer. Through this blog, I am going to share my interests, skills, hobbies, and personal experiences with

    <!------------ about yourself and education ------------>
    <div class="md:text-xl text-lg  text-justify  p-2">

      <p class="indent-12">I'm pleased to share some information about myself with
        you. I hail
        from the district of Kavrepalanchok in Nepal, specifically the town of Panchkhal. As a resident of this
        beautiful region, I've been fortunate to experience the natural beauty and cultural richness of Nepal.</p>
      <br>
      <p> I completed my secondary education from Golden
        Future Higher Secondary School in my hometown, where I received a solid education in various subjects and
        achieved a GPA of 3.70 in the SEE exams. Following that, I pursued my +2 degree in Physical Science from
        Liverpool International College in Kathmandu, where I learned about the fundamental principles of Physics,
        Chemistry, and Mathematics. I graduated with an overall GPA of 3.15 and was able to develop my problem-solving
        and analytical skills.

        Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology (BIT) from Texas International College in
        Kathmandu. The program has provided me with an opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of
        technology and computer science. I am eager to learn about the latest technologies and develop my expertise in
        programming, database management, and system administration.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My academic qualifications have prepared me well for a career in the technology industry. I am confident that
        the knowledge and experience I have gained will enable me to make valuable contributions in any role that I take
        on. I am excited to continue my education and take on new challenges in the field of Information Technology.</p>

    <!-------------- about behaviour --------->

    <div class="md:text-xl text-lg  text-justify my-4 p-2">
      <p class="indent-12 ">From a young age, I have always been an introverted person. I am someone who enjoys my own
        company and often
        prefers to spend time alone rather than in a large group. I find solace in books, music, and art, and these
        hobbies have always been a source of comfort for me. Growing up, I was known to be an innocent and polite child.
        I have always treated others with respect and kindness, and these values have stayed with me through the years.

        As I navigated through various stages of life, I learned that my introverted nature was a strength rather than a
        weakness. It allowed me to think deeply and creatively about the world around me, and I was able to develop a
        unique perspective on things. While I may not be the most outgoing person in the room, I am always willing to
        listen and engage in meaningful conversations with others.</p><br>
</div>
      <!------------ about hobbies ------->
      <div class="md:text-xl text-lg  text-justify my-4  p-2">
      <p class="indent-12 ">
        One of my favorite pastimes is studying and learning about new things. I find it exciting to delve into a
        subject and gain a deeper understanding of it. Whether it's reading books, researching online, or attending
        classes, I enjoy expanding my knowledge and learning something new every day.
        Another hobby of mine is watching sports, specifically football and cricket. I find it fascinating to see
        athletes push themselves to the limit and showcase their skills on the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also enjoy exploring new places and experiencing different cultures.
        Whether it's traveling to a new city or exploring a remote area, I find it exhilarating to discover new sights,
        sounds, and tastes.
        Along with exploring new places, I also love to immerse myself in natural beauty. Spending time in peaceful
        places surrounded by fresh air and beautiful scenery is a great way for me to recharge and reconnect with
        myself. Whether it's hiking in the mountains, walking along the beach, or simply sitting in a park, I find that
        being in nature brings a sense of calm and tranquility to my life.
      </p><br>
      <p>During my free time, I enjoy watching a variety of movies, particularly those that fall under the genres of
        science fiction, suspense-thriller, comedy, and motivational films. These movies provide me with an escape from
        reality and allow me to engage with different emotions and experiences.

        Some of my favorite movies that fall under these genres include "The Shawshank Redemption," "Predestination,"
        "The Pursuit of Happyness," "Shutter Island," and "Borat." These movies have a compelling storyline and
        characters that keep me engaged and entertained. They also inspire me to think deeply about different aspects of
        life, whether it's the human condition or social commentary.
        When it comes to TV series, I enjoy watching shows that are both funny and thought-provoking. Some of my
        favorites include "Friends," "The Big Bang Theory," "How I Met Your Mother," and "Breaking Bad." These shows
        have unique characters and storylines that keep me engaged and entertained.</p>
      <p>
        One of my biggest musical interests is classic rock bands, particularly Queen and Pink Floyd, whose music I find
        to be timeless and powerful. Their songs have a unique sound and style that has captivated me for years, and I
        continue to be drawn to their music.

        In addition to classic rock, I also enjoy listening to the songs of Arijit Singh, a popular Indian singer, and
        Narayan Gopal, a legendary Nepali singer. Arijit Singh's soulful and melodious voice adds a romantic and
        emotional touch to his songs, while Narayan Gopal's voice and compositions have a nostalgic and sentimental
        quality that touches my heart.</p>

        <h1 class="font-bold underline text:xl md:text-2xl">Web development</h1>
        <p class="indent-12">
          I have a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, which allows me to create static web pages and style them according
          to specific design requirements. I am proficient in using CSS to create custom styles and layouts for
          different elements of a web page, such as headers, text, images, and forms. I also use HTML and CSS to
          optimize web pages for search engine optimization (SEO) by using best practices such as semantic markup and
          structured data.

          In addition to HTML and CSS, I have experience in using Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS frameworks to create
          responsive web designs that look great on different devices and screen sizes. Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS are
          powerful tools that provide pre-built components and styles that I can use to create custom designs quickly
          and efficiently.

          Finally, I am skilled in using JavaScript to create interactive features on web pages. I use JavaScript to
          enhance user experience by adding dynamic elements such as animations, pop-ups, and user input validation. I
          also use JavaScript to implement web page functionality such as form submissions, data processing, and
          communication with web servers using APIs.

          My skills in web development enable me to create visually appealing and functional websites that
          provide an optimal user experience. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest web development
          trends and technologies, and I continuously seek to improve my skills through learning and practice.

          <p class="font-bold underline text:xl md:text-2xl">Simple Calculator</p>
          <p> Simple calculator is a web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as
            addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator interface is designed using HTML and CSS
            to create a clean and intuitive layout that is easy to use. Users can enter numeric values and select the
            desired operation using buttons provided on the calculator interface.

            The calculator functionality is implemented using JavaScript, which enables the application to perform
            real-time calculations based on user input. When a user clicks on an arithmetic operation button, the
            calculator retrieves the values entered by the user and performs the corresponding calculation. The result
            is
            displayed on the calculator interface in real-time, allowing users to see the outcome of their calculations
            immediately.</p><br>

          <p class="font-bold underline text:xl md:text-2xl">Joke Creator</p>
          <p> "Dad Jokes" website is a fun and entertaining web application that provides a collection of corny and
            hilarious jokes that are sure to make users laugh. The interface of the website is designed using HTML and
            CSS to create a clean and minimalistic layout that is easy to navigate. The main focus of the website is on
            the jokes, which are displayed on the interface using custom-designed fonts and colors.

            The functionality of the website is implemented using JavaScript, which allows users to generate random
            jokes by clicking on a button. When a user clicks on the "Tell me a joke" button, the website retrieves a
            joke from a pre-written database of Dad jokes and displays it on the interface in real-time. Users can also
            click on a button to display the punchline of the joke, revealing the hilarious ending to the joke.

            In addition to generating jokes, your website also allows users to rate jokes based on how funny they are.
            This feature is implemented using JavaScript to create custom rating buttons that allow users to rate jokes
            on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Users can also submit their own jokes to the database, which can be viewed and
            rated by other users</p><br>
